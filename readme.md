# How to run our game
Hi there Frank or Matthijs! To run our game, simply run 'cabal run' in the root directory.

If that fails, try 'cabal run all'.

# How to play
- You move up and down using the arrow buttons.
- Shooting happens when you press the 'right' arrow button.
- Pausing can be done by smashing the spacebar
- To load and save the gamestate to a JSON file, press 'I' and 'O' respectively.

We hope you enjoy it!
